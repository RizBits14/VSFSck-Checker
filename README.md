# vsfsck-checker
A simple file system checker for the Very Simple File System (VSFS), written in C. This tool reads a virtual file system image (vsfs.img), checks for errors in the superblock, inodes, bitmaps, and data blocks, and reports or fixes the problems.

**Recommended**

The `Tests` folder has all the code dump in it. It has all the code divided into 6 individual parts

A **screenshot** here is attached for the execution of the .c files in the `Tests` folder
